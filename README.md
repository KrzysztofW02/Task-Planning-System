# Task Planning System

Welcome to the Task Planning System repository! This is a microservices-based application built with C# in the backend and TypeScript, React, and Vite in the frontend. This system aims to streamline task management and planning for teams.

## Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: Built using a microservices architecture for scalability, modularity, and easy maintenance.
- **Backend in C#**: Utilizes C# for robust backend services, ensuring efficient data handling and processing.
- **Frontend with TypeScript, React, and Vite**: Offers a modern and responsive user interface powered by TypeScript, React, and Vite, enabling seamless user interactions and dynamic updates.
- **Task Management**: Allows users to create, assign, prioritize, and track tasks efficiently.
- **Team Collaboration**: Facilitates collaboration among team members by providing features for sharing tasks, commenting, and updating task statuses.
- **Containerization**: Containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability across different environments.
- **RESTful APIs**: Implements RESTful APIs for seamless communication between frontend and backend services.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Ensures secure access to the system with authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Database Integration**: Integrates with a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for storing task-related data.
